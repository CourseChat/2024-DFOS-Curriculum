    " #### Goal: Enable a class to build systems capable of demonstrating the truth of this statement: \n",
    " *The system provides strain data every 4 inches (10 centimeters) with a spatial resolution of 3.3 feet (1 meter) and a strain precision of +20 µε and a temperature precision of +1.8° Fahrenheit (1°C).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide students with programmable interrogators and a variety of existing fiber collection systems with existing historical data sets. In contrast to today's vendor-controlled environment, where the [Luna OBR-4600](https://lunainc.com/product/obr-4600) or the [Luna Quant-X](https://www.optasense.com/technology/quantx/) constrain users to Luna-provided visualizations and analysis, open systems allow freedom to explore in a rapidly changing environment . Explore tradeoffs of resolution, spatial accuracy, and precision, with freedom to configure fibers, lasers, photodetectors, and detector regimes for a variety of sensing challenges.\n",

    "More deeply, provide students with the mathematical and computational skills to innovate as technology changes.\n",

    "In this MATLAB code, it appears the peak Brillouin frequency for each file is being computed by performing a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and then finding the maximum frequency in the resulting frequency domain representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "**parfor fileidx = 1:numfile:** This loop runs through each file where numfile is the total number of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "data(:,fileidx);: This accesses the data corresponding to the fileidxth file.\n",
    "\n",
    "reshape(I, [ReadingLength, FileAver]);: This reshapes the data from the file into a 2D-array, where each column corresponds to a different segment of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "PH_STFT(I, advance,ReadingLength,nFFT,FileAver);: **This performs the short-time Fourier transform on the reshaped data. This will result in a time-frequency representation of the signal.**\n",
    "\n",
    "After looping through each file, **the function collects the results to compute the mean spectrum using X_mean_dB = 10*log10((X_accum_folder./FileNum).^2);.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The mean spectrum is then processed further (flip, mean subtraction, resampling) to isolate the relevant features and to reduce noise.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The maximum frequency (peak) in the processed mean spectrum is then found using [X_peaks, I] = max(X_resamp, [], 1);, where X_resamp is the resampled mean spectrum.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**brillouin_peaks = peakfreqs(I); pinpoints the Brillouin peaks at the locations of maximal frequency.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Brillouin peak frequencies are plotted against distance using plot(distance/100, brillouin_peaks), and the results are saved (save(profilename,'brillouin_peaks','-v6');).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the PH_STFT function is user-defined and isn't provided in the given MATLAB code, so I've speculated its functionality based on typical practice and the name of the function. STFT is a common method used in signal analysis to determine the frequency content of local sections of a signal as it changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This code essentially processes each file's data to extract the dominant (peak) Brillouin frequency for each segment of the signal, which is then used in the analysis and plotted for visual representation. These peaks represent the most significant frequency components in each section of the fiber, which can be directly linked to the physical properties (like temperature and strain) at the corresponding fiber location.**\n",

    "---\n",

    "The digital signal from the fiber optic cable, which is an electrical signal converted from the optical signal passing through the cable, is likely to be processed by a Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform is a mathematical tool that transforms a function of time, a time domain signal, into a function of frequency, called a frequency domain signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, Fourier Transform breaks down the original signal into a set of sine and cosine waves of different frequencies. By identifying the frequency content of the signal, we can identify the characteristics of the signal and its components at each frequency. This is particularly useful in fiber optics where different frequencies can be associated with different data streams, enabling us to identify and isolate each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of fiber optic sensors (e.g., distributed fiber optic sensing, DFOS), the \"length\" of fiber that a given datapoint represents can be determined by the speed of light (in the fiber) and the time of arrival of the backscattered signal. Each sampled data point in the signal acquisition can be mapped to a location in the fiber.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fourier Domain analysis of these signals, the frequencies present give us information about the variation of the physical parameter being measured (temperature, strain etc.) along the length of the fiber.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the MATLAB code snippet in question lacks detail on this processing. Additional understanding of the specific sensor system setup and its signal processing steps would be required for a precise explanation.\n",
