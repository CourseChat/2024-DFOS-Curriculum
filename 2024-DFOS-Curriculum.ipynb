    "### Outline \n",
    " Based on discussions by the 2023-2024 DFOS Alicia Working Group and by the projects of the SRG 2023 Summer Intern program, this is a sketch of a possible short course: **Building Infrastructure Health Monitoring Systems**. \n",
    " \n",
    " **Approach**: Start with one of the seven SRG published papers listed below. Examine the technical components it uses: the physical infrastructure monitored; the desired monitoring values; the DFOS FUT physical structure; the interrogater component structure; the past and present vendors of optical, RF, power and computing components; potential optical, RF, power components;desired interrogator parameters;  computing and data storage elements; appropriate use of Brillouin, Raman, Rayleigh, or other data sources; updated software stack; the data acquisition and analysis logic.  \n",
    " \n",
    " Using the existing sensor structure from each paper or ongoing project, **build or re-engineer** the interrogator technology using new **RFSoC** hardware and software. This will entail moving existing code from MATLAB to Python, deciding on the appropriate Python libraries, building an sequence of Jupyter Notebooks to implement the new functionality, and designing the appropriate fabric of optical, RF, and computational components given tne new capabilities of the **RFSoC** system.\n",
    "\n",
    " Spurred by the sudden availability of an [**unexpectedly powerful computational environment from the University of Strathclyde**](https://www.rfsocbook.com/), we suggest **reimplementing seven existing SRG research projects**  using the new, integrated, shared hardware and software environment provided by the RFSoC system: integrated parallel computation, FPGA, FFT, GPU, RF, photonics, and a software environment built on Jupyter Notebooks, Python, and hard-coded FPGA hardware support. \n",
    "\n",
    " **Immediate goal: explore pathways for 100X interrogator cost reduction** ; explore Brillouin, Raleigh, Raman multi-mode operation with a variety of phase,polarity or frequency-scanning options. Characterize expansion of today's sensing and monitoring market--from oil/gas to all infrastructure--based on 100X cost reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    " In exploring each integration, use the existing project sensor infrastructure. Extend it, using new RFSoC communications capabilities, new data analysis environments, and new computational extensions. Substitute new hardware capabilities for prior computational workflows in sampling, spectrum analysis, and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    " Accompany each reimplementation with an accompanying expanded curriculum: applied mathematics (linear algebra), signal processing, programming languages, photonics, spectrum  analysis, computational architecture, metamaterials, machine learning, testing and validation, and design.\n",
    "\n",
    " In each project, expand interrogator capabilities; explore Brillouin, Raleigh, Raman modes; expand temperature and strain measurements; integrate with digital twin environments; expand 3D visualization; explore ground-penetrating radar; "

    "## GPT-4 does quick look at MATLAB code for Alicia\n",
    "\n",
    "instructor: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this MATLAB code, it appears the peak Brillouin frequency for each file is being computed by performing a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and then finding the maximum frequency in the resulting frequency domain representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "parfor fileidx = 1:numfile: This loop runs through each file where numfile is the total number of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "data(:,fileidx);: This accesses the data corresponding to the fileidxth file.\n",
    "\n",
    "reshape(I, [ReadingLength, FileAver]);: This reshapes the data from the file into a 2D-array, where each column corresponds to a different segment of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "PH_STFT(I, advance,ReadingLength,nFFT,FileAver);: This performs the short-time Fourier transform on the reshaped data. This will result in a time-frequency representation of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "After looping through each file, the function collects the results to compute the mean spectrum using X_mean_dB = 10*log10((X_accum_folder./FileNum).^2);.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean spectrum is then processed further (flip, mean subtraction, resampling) to isolate the relevant features and to reduce noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum frequency (peak) in the processed mean spectrum is then found using [X_peaks, I] = max(X_resamp, [], 1);, where X_resamp is the resampled mean spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "brillouin_peaks = peakfreqs(I); pinpoints the Brillouin peaks at the locations of maximal frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Brillouin peak frequencies are plotted against distance using plot(distance/100, brillouin_peaks), and the results are saved (save(profilename,'brillouin_peaks','-v6');).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the PH_STFT function is user-defined and isn't provided in the given MATLAB code, so I've speculated its functionality based on typical practice and the name of the function. STFT is a common method used in signal analysis to determine the frequency content of local sections of a signal as it changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code essentially processes each file's data to extract the dominant (peak) Brillouin frequency for each segment of the signal, which is then used in the analysis and plotted for visual representation. These peaks represent the most significant frequency components in each section of the fiber, which can be directly linked to the physical properties (like temperature and strain) at the corresponding fiber location.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The digital signal from the fiber optic cable, which is an electrical signal converted from the optical signal passing through the cable, is likely to be processed by a Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform is a mathematical tool that transforms a function of time, a time domain signal, into a function of frequency, called a frequency domain signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, Fourier Transform breaks down the original signal into a set of sine and cosine waves of different frequencies. By identifying the frequency content of the signal, we can identify the characteristics of the signal and its components at each frequency. This is particularly useful in fiber optics where different frequencies can be associated with different data streams, enabling us to identify and isolate each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of fiber optic sensors (e.g., distributed fiber optic sensing, DFOS), the \"length\" of fiber that a given datapoint represents can be determined by the speed of light (in the fiber) and the time of arrival of the backscattered signal. Each sampled data point in the signal acquisition can be mapped to a location in the fiber.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fourier Domain analysis of these signals, the frequencies present give us information about the variation of the physical parameter being measured (temperature, strain etc.) along the length of the fiber.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the MATLAB code snippet in question lacks detail on this processing. Additional understanding of the specific sensor system setup and its signal processing steps would be required for a precise explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to have a deep understanding of the system under consideration when interpreting the results of such data analyses - especially when assigning physical meaning to the frequency content of such signals.\n",
