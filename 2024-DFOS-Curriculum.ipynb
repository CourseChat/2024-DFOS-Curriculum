    "### Outline \n",
    " Based on discussions by the 2023-2024 DFOS Alicia Working Group and by the projects of the SRG 2023 Summer Intern program, this is a sketch of a possible short course: **Building Infrastructure Health Monitoring Systems**. \n",
    " \n",
    " **Approach**: Start with published paper. Examine technical components used: physical objects monitored; DFOS FUT physical structure; interrogater component structure,vendors,optical components; interrogator parameters; optical, RF, computing elements; Brillouin, Raman, Rayleigh, other; software stack;data acquisition and analysis.  Use existing sensor structure from each paper, **build or re-engineer** interrogator technology using new **RFSoC** hardware and software.\n",
    "\n",
    " Spurred by the sudden availability of an [**unexpectedly powerful computational environment from the University of Strathclyde**](https://www.rfsocbook.com/), we suggest **reimplementing seven existing research projects**  using the new, integrated, shared hardware and software environment provided by the RFSoC system: integrated parallel computation, FPGA, FFT, GPU, RF, photonics. \n",
    "\n",
    " Immediate goal: explore pathways for 100X interrogator cost reduction ; explore Brillouin, Raleigh, Raman multi-mode operation with a variety of phase,polarity or frequency-scanning options. Characterize expansion of today's sensing and monitoring market--from oil/gas to all infrastructure--based on 100X cost reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    " In exploring each integration, use the existing project sensor infrastructure. Extend it, using new RFSoC communications capabilities, new data analysis environments, and new computational extensions. Substitute new hardware capabilities for prior computational workflows in sampling, spectrum analysis, and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    " Accompany each reimplementation with an accompanying expanded curriculum: applied mathematics (linear algebra), signal processing, programming languages, photonics, spectrum  analysis, computational architecture, metamaterials, machine learning, testing and validation, and design.\n",
    "\n",
    " In each project, expand interrogator capabilities; explore Brillouin, Raleigh, Raman modes; expand temperature and strain measurements; integrate with digital twin environments; expand 3D visualization; explore ground-penetrating radar; "
